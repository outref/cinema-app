```
RESTful, API-based movie theater application that implements authentication and
authorization with Spring Security.
```
## üöÄ Demo
To avoid the hassle of running the application locally to try it out, you can use deployed demo by this address: http://13.48.85.241:8080/cinema-app  
Postman collection - [Endpoints for testing](https://www.postman.com/outref/workspace/workspace/collection/26840886-893bc5e7-be31-4bd1-b703-59cd15cd19b4)

## üîê Security
Application implements Basic Auth scheme, which means that user's email and password have to be sent with every HTTP-request inside of a Authorization header (encoded in Base64). 
This can be easily configured in Postman on Authorization tab for testing purposes.

At launch application injects two default users into DB:

[ADMIN] - admin@i.ua - admin123

[USER] - user@i.ua - user123

They can be used for testing both locally or in demo app. 


## üéØ Features (API endpoints)

*{"email":"test@email.com", "password":"12345678", "repeatPassword":"12345678"}*
- `GET /cinema-halls`  [USER or ADMIN] : get list of all cinema halls
