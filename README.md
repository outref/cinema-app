``
RESTful, API-based application that provides basic features of a movie theater and implements authentication, authorization and input validation.
``
## üöÄ Demo
To avoid the hassle of running the application locally, try it out using deployed demo by this address: http://13.48.85.241:8080/cinema-app  
Test the demo endpoints with this Postman collection - [Cinema-app collection](https://www.postman.com/outref/workspace/cinema-app/collection/26840886-893bc5e7-be31-4bd1-b703-59cd15cd19b4?action=share&creator=26840886)

## üîê Security
Application implements Basic Auth scheme, which means that user's email and password have to be sent with every HTTP-request inside of a Authorization header (encoded in Base64). 
This can be easily configured in Postman on Authorization tab for testing purposes.  

At launch application auto-inects two default users into DB:  
[ADMIN] - admin@i.ua - admin123  
[USER] - user@i.ua - user123  
They can be used for testing both locally or in demo app.
